.. _1.3.0:

1.3.0 (July 01, 2007)
---------------------

Bug Fixes:
  - Bug fixes.

Eclim:
  - New graphical installer for easing the installation and upgrading
    procedure.
  - In previous releases of eclim, any time a command required access to
    the eclipse representation of a source file, eclim would force a full
    refresh of the current project to ensure that any external additions,
    deletions, or changes to other files would be automatically detected.
    However, this approach, while convenient and transparent to the user,
    comes with a performance penalty that grows as the project size grows.

    For some users this performance penalty has been more noticeable than
    for others.  So in response to this feedback, eclim no longer performs
    an automatic project refresh.  What this means for you is that any time
    you perform an action that results in any file additions, deletions, or
    changes, like a svn / cvs update, you should issue a :ref:`:ProjectRefresh`
    to ensure that eclipse and eclim are updated with the latest version of the
    files on disk.
  - :ref:`:ProjectCreate` now supports optional -p argument for specifying the
    project name to use.
  - Created new command :ref:`:ProjectRefreshAll` to support refreshing all
    projects at once, and modified :ref:`:ProjectRefresh` to only refresh the
    current project if no project names are supplied.
  - Added
    :ref:`:ProjectGrep`,
    :ref:`:ProjectGrepAdd`,
    :ref:`:ProjectLGrep`, and
    :ref:`:ProjectLGrepAdd`.
  - Added support for buffer local variable
    **b:EclimLocationListFilter** which can contain a list of
    regular expression patterns used to filter location list entries with
    text / message field matching one of the patterns.  The main intention
    of this new variable is to allow you to filter out validation errors /
    warnings per file type, that you wish to ignore.

    Example which I have in my .vim/ftplugin/html/html.vim file\:

    .. code-block:: vim

      let b:EclimLocationListFilter = [
          \ '<table> lacks "summary" attribute'
        \ ]

Css:
  - Added :ref:`css code completion <vim/css/complete>`.  Requires the
    `eclipse wst`_ plugin.

Dtd:
  - Added :ref:`dtd validation <vim/dtd/validate>`.  Requires the
    `eclipse wst`_ plugin.

Html:
  - Added :ref:`html code completion <vim/html/complete>`.  Requires the
    `eclipse wst`_ plugin.
  - Added :ref:`html validation <vim/html/validate>`.  Requires the
    `eclipse wst`_ plugin.

Log4j:
  - Added :ref:`log4j xml file validation <vim/java/log4j/validate>`.

Python:
  - Added support for :ref:`testing regular expressions <vim/python/regex>`.

Django:
  - Added
    :ref:`:DjangoManage`,
    :ref:`:DjangoFind`,
    :ref:`:DjangoTemplateOpen`,
    :ref:`:DjangoViewOpen`, and
    :ref:`:DjangoContextOpen`.

WebXml:
  - Added :ref:`web.xml file validation <vim/java/webxml/validate>`.

Vim:
  - Added
    :ref:`:ArgsRelative`,
    :ref:`:ArgAddRelative`,
    :ref:`:ReadRelative`.
  - Added
    :ref:`:Sign`,
    :ref:`:Signs`,
    :ref:`:SignClearUser`,
    :ref:`:SignClearAll`.

Vcs:
  - Added
    :ref:`:VcsAnnotate` and :Viewvc.

Wsdl:
  - Added :ref:`wsdl validation <vim/wsdl/validate>`.  Requires the
    `eclipse wst`_ plugin.

Xsd:
  - Added :ref:`xsd validation <vim/xsd/validate>`.  Requires the
    `eclipse wst`_ plugin.

Xml:
  - Added :ref:`xml code completion <vim/xml/complete>`.  Requires the
