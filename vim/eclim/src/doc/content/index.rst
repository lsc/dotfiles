==================
Overview
==================

The primary goal of eclim is to bring Eclipse_ functionality to the Vim_
editor.  The initial goal was to provide Eclipse's java functionality in vim,
but support for various other languages (c/c++, php, python, ruby, css, html,
xml, etc.) have been added and several more are planned.

Eclim is less of an application and more of an integration of two great
projects.
The first, Vim, is `arguably <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_wars>`_
one of the best text editors in existence.  The second, Eclipse, provides many
great tools for development in various languages.  Each provides many features
that can increase developer productivity, but both still leave something to be
desired.  Vim lacks native Java support and many of the advanced features
available in Eclipse. Eclipse, on the other hand, still requires the use of the
mouse for many things, and when compared to Vim, provides a less than ideal
interface for editing text.

That is where eclim comes into play.  Instead of trying to write an IDE in Vim
or a Vim editor in Eclipse, eclim provides an Eclipse plug-in that exposes
Eclipse features through a server interface, and a set of Vim plug-ins that
communicate with Eclipse over that interface.  This functionality can be
leveraged in three primary ways, as illustrated below.

.. image:: images/diagrams/use_cases.png

#. The :ref:`first scenario <eclimd_headless>` is for those for which vim is
   their primary editing interface.  In this scenario you run a headless
   instance of eclipse which all vim instances can then communicate with to
   provide the various eclipse features.

#. The :ref:`second scenario <eclimd_headed>` is for those who prefer using vim
   as their main interface, but frequently end up jumping back to eclipse for
   any features not provided by eclim.  In this case you can run the eclim
   server inside of the eclipse gui and then interact with it via external vim
   instances just like the first scenario.

#. The :ref:`last scenario <gvim_embedded>` is for those who wish to use the
   eclipse interface full time, but want to use gvim as an embedded eclipse
   editor. Just like the previous use case, the eclim server is run inside of
   the eclipse gui and the embedded gvim will interact with it just like
   external vim instances would.

| Please note that eclim now requires the latest version of `eclipse`_
  (Ganymede, 3.4.x).

Also note that the eclipse pdt plugin which serves as the base for eclim's php
support has not yet been released for the latest version of eclipse.  For this
reason php support has been temporarily removed from this release and will
hopefully return soon after the pdt team release a Ganymede (3.4) compatible
version.

Another major change worth noting, is that eclim is now licensed under the
GPLv3.  This was done to give eclim the freedom to integrate with other GPL
projects in the future.
