Java Validation
===============

When saving a java source file that resides in a project, eclim will update that
source file in Eclipse and will report any validation errors found.  Any errors
will be placed in the current window's location list (:help location-list) and
the corresponding lines in the source file will be marked via Vim's :sign
functionality with '>>' markers in the left margin.

Automatic validation of java source files can be disabled via the
**g:EclimJavaSrcValidate** variable (described below).  If you choose to disable
automatic validation, you can still use the **:Validate** command to manually
validate the current file.
