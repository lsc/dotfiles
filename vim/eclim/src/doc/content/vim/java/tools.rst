Java Tools Integration
======================

.. _\:Jps:

As of Java 1.5 (Java 5.0), the sun jdk started shipping with some useful tools
for viewing information about running java processes.  To provide quick and easy
access to some of the information these commands provide, eclim exposes the
command **:Jps**.

.. note::

  For more information on the jdk tools you may view the `online
  documentation`_.

When invoked it will open a window containing information about the current
processes and some links for viewing additional info (depending upon
availability of required tools on your platform).

Example content:

- Line 1 consists of the process id followed by either the class name the
  process was started with or the path to the jar file.
- Lines 2 - 4 contains links that when you hit <enter> on, will open another
  window displaying the requested additional info.
- Lines 6 - 31 is a folded block which contains a list of all the arguments
  passed to the main method of the process.
- Lines 33 - 35 is a folded block which contains a list of all the arguments
  passed to the JVM.
