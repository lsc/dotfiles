Java Code Correction
====================

.. _\:JavaCorrect:

Code correction in eclim is equivalent to the quick fix functionality of
Eclipse. When you save a java source file, eclim
:ref:`validates <vim/java/validate>` the file and notes which lines contain
errors.  To have eclim suggest possible corrections for an error, you simply
place the cursor on the error line and issue **:JavaCorrect**.

The result will be a small window opened at the bottom of Vim where any
correction proposals will be noted. To apply a suggested change, simply move the
cursor to the line describing the modification and hit <enter>. Upon doing so,
the change will be applied to the source file.

Example output of **:JavaCorrect**.

::

  The serializable class Foo does not declare a static final serialVersionUID field of type long
  0.1227:  Add @SuppressWarnings 'serial' to 'Foo'
    ...
    @SuppressWarnings("serial")
    public class Foo
    implements Serializable
  ...

To apply the above change you would hit <enter> on the line\:

::

  0.1227:  Add @SuppressWarnings 'serial' to 'Foo'

.. note::

  The code correction is done externally with Eclipse and with that comes a
  couple :ref:`caveats <vim/issues>`.
