TestNG
======

Currently eclim's support for TestNG_ is limited to supporting Vim's :make in
conjunction with ant to populate vim's quickfix results with failed test cases.

By default TestNG's output to the console is very terse.  So in order to support
monitoring of failed test cases via vim's error format, eclim provides a custom
TestNG listener which must be installed into your build environment.

#.  The first step is to place the ``eclim-misc.jar`` file in your TestNG
    classpath you have configured for ant.  You can find this jar file in your
    $ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclim_version/ directory.
#.  The second step is to add the ``listener`` attribute to your
    testng task which references the required eclim testng listener\:

    ::

        ...
      <testng ... listener="org.eclim.misc.testng.TestNgListener">
        ...

    See the `testng ant task docs`_ for more information.

Once you have completed that setup, you should then be able to run your ant
target from vim and (as long as eclim is running) all failed test cases will be
added to your vim quickfix results.

Ex. Assuming your ant task is named 'test':

.. code-block:: vim

  :Ant test
