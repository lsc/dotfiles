Abbreviations
=============

Eclim provides the following Vim abbreviations\:

- **fori**

  .. code-block:: java

    for (int ii = 0; ii < ${array}.length; ii++){
    }

- **forI**

  .. code-block:: java

    for (Iterator ii = ${col}.iterator(); ii.hasNext();){
    }

- **fore**

  .. code-block:: java

    for (${object} ${var} : ${col}){
    }

When editing a java source file simply enter the abbreviation while in insert
mode, followed by a space or <ESC> and the corresponding code above will be
added for you.

You will also notice that the code above has replacement variables in the form
of ${variable}.  When the abbreviation is expanded, eclim will remove the first
variable and position the cursor at that position so that you can fill in the
appropriate value.  Additional values, if any, can be replaced by using the
``FillTemplate`` funtion (please see the
:ref:`suggested mappings <JavaMappings>` for more information). The variable
will be removed and the cursor placed in its position for you to again enter
the appropriate value in its place.

For example, to use the for each (or enhanced for) abbreviation above to iterate
over an array of Date objects stored in a variable "dates", you would simply
(assuming you mapped the template replacement to <Tab>)\:

#. Enter insert mode.</li>
#. Type "fore" followed by a space.</li>
#. Type "Date", then <ESC>.</li>
#. Hit <Tab>.</li>
#. Type "date", then <ESC>.</li>
#. Hit <Tab> again.</li>
#. Type "dates", then <ESC>.</li>

After that sequence you would have the following code.

.. code-block:: java

  for (Date date : dates){
  }

With the for each example you will only save yourself a few keystrokes, but with
the other for loop abbreviations you can save many more.
