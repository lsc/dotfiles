Java Bean Functionality
=======================

Eclim currently provides the ability to generate java bean getters and setters
from one or more defined fields.


.. _\:JavaGetSet:

- **:JavaGetSet** -
  Generates both getters and setters for the field under the cursor or for
  all fields in the specified range.

.. _\:JavaGet:

- **:JavaGet** -
  Generates getters for the field under the cursor or for all fields in
  the specified range.

.. _\:JavaSet:

- **:JavaSet** -
  Generates setters for the field under the cursor or for all fields in
  the specified range.

Given the following file\:

.. code-block:: java

  public class Foo
  {
    private String name;
    private Bar[] bars;
  }

You can place the cursor on one of the fields and execute **:JavaGetSet** to
generate the getters and setters for the field.  All of the above commands
support ranges as well, so you can use a visual selection or a numbered range to
generate methods for a set of fields.

.. note::

  The insertion of these methods is done externally with Eclipse and with
  that comes a couple :ref:`caveats <vim/issues>`.
