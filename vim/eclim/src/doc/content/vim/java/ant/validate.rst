Ant File Validation
===================

When editing an ant xml file eclim will default to validating the file when it
is written.  Any errors will be added to the current window's location list
(:help location-list) and their corresponding line number noted via Vim's sign
functionality.

Currently the Eclipse ant file validation isn't as robust as one might hope.  It
doesn't validate that element attributes are correct, that child elements are
valid, etc., but it does perform the following\:

- If a default target is specified, validate that it exists and that the target
  dependencies exist.
- Check for missing dependencies.
- Check for circular dependencies.

Eclim also combines the above validation with
:ref:`xml validation <vim/xml/validate>` to validate that the ant file is well
formed.

If you do not want your ant files validated automatically when saved, you can
set the :ref:`g:EclimAntValidate` variable described in the configuration
section below.

.. _\:Validate_ant:

Whether or not auto validation has been enabled, eclim also exposes the command
**:Validate** to manually execute the validation of the ant file.
