Ant Code Completion
===================

Ant code completion uses the standard
:ref:`Vim code completion mechanism <vim/code_completion>` like so\:

::

  <ja<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>
  <jar de<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>
  <jar destfile="${bas<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>
  <jar destfile="${basdir
  ...

Screenshot of completion in action\:

.. warning::

  If your ant file has a lot of imports, then the code completion may be slow as
  Eclipse parses all the imports when creating the ant model.  You will notice
  the same slow behavior when using Eclipse directly.
