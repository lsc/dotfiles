Xml Code Completion
===================

Xml code completion uses the standard
:ref:`Vim code completion mechanism <vim/code_completion>` like so\:

::

  <ser<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

  <servlet>
    <ser<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>
  ...


.. note::

  Requires a valid dtd or xsd to determine possible completions.

In addition to the standard code completion, eclim also supports auto
completion of end tags. When you type '</' eclim will attempt to determine
which element you are closing and complete it for you.  If you wish to disable
this feature you can simply set g:EclimSgmlCompleteEndTag to 0.


Configuration
--------------

Vim Variables

.. _g\:EclimSgmlCompleteEndTag:

- **g:EclimSgmlCompleteEndTag** -
  If set to 0, disables auto completion of end tags.

.. _g\:EclimSgmlCompleteEndTagIgnore:

- **b:EclimSgmlCompleteEndTagIgnore** -
  Buffer local variable that can be set to a list of tags to ignore when
  searching for the start tag to complete.

  Example that can be added to an html ftplugin file\:

  .. code-block:: vim

    let b:EclimSgmlCompleteEndTagIgnore = ['br', 'input']
