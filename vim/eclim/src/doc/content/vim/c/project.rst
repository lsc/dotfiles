C/C++ Project Configuration
===========================

.. note::
  This feature is currently considered alpha.  If you have any issues or
  suggestions please submit them to the `eclim user`_ mailing list.

  Also, please note that should you need access to the full set of cdt
  configuration options, you can always open the eclipse gui (after stopping
  any headless eclimd instance you may have running) and access those options
  via the standard cdt project dialogs.

The eclipse cdt provides a large set of configuration support for your c/c++
projects.  Eclim exposes a subset of these to you using the
**:CProjectConfigs** command:

.. code-block:: vim

  :CProjectConfigs

  " or if you are outside of the project
  :CProjectConfigs my_c_project

This command will open a temporary buffer displaying some of the cdt
configuration values available to you.  In this buffer you can add or remove
source directory references, include path references, and symbols.

Here is a small example of what the contents may look like:

::

  Config: Linux GCC

    Sources: |add|
      dir:    src

    Tool: GCC C Compiler
      Includes: |add|
        path:    "${workspace_loc:/my_c_project/includes}"
      Symbols:  |add|

    Tool: GCC Assembler
      Includes: |add|

To add a source directory, include path, or symbol, simply move the cursor over
the relevant "\|add\|" link and hit <enter>.  You will then be prompted to
enter an appropriate value.  For your convenience, tab completion is provided
where possible.

.. note::

  Despite the odd looking value in the includes path section above, to add the
  entry you simply need to supply the project relative path, "includes/" in
  this case, when prompted by the add command.

If at any point you would like to remove a value, you can move the cursor over
the line of the value you would like to remove and hit D (shift-d) to delete
the entry.
