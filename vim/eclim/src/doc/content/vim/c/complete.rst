C/C++ Code Completion
=====================

C/C++ code completion uses the standard
:ref:`Vim code completion mechanism <vim/code_completion>` like so\:

.. code-block:: c

  #include <st<C-X><C-U>
  #include <stio.h>

  int main(void) {
    pu<C-X><C-U>
    puts(
    puts("Hello World");
    return EX<C-X><C-U>
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
  }

.. note::
  This feature depends on the eclipse cdt_ which should be installed for you
  when choosing c/c++ support in the eclim installer.
