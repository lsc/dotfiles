Python Code Completion
======================

Python code completion uses the standard
:ref:`Vim code completion mechanism <vim/code_completion>` like so\:

.. code-block:: python

  class Test (object):
    def testMethod (self):
      pass

  t = Test()
  t.te<C-X><C-U>
  t.testMethod

.. note::

  Code completion support is provided via eclim's integration with
  :ref:`rope <vim/python/rope>`.

  Please see the :ref:`rope <vim/python/rope>` docs for more information.
