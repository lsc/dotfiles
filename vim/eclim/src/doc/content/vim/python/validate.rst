Python Validation
=================

When editing a python file eclim will default to validating the file when it is
written.  Any errors will be added to the current window's location list (:help
location-list) and their corresponding line number noted via Vim's sign
functionality.

Python validation currently uses both the python compiler to check for syntax
errors and pyflakes_ to perform some additional validation.  To make use of the
pyflakes portion of the validation you will first need to install pyflakes and
make sure it is in your path.

If you don't want python files validated when saving them, you can set the
g:EclimPythonValidate variable described in the configuration section below.

.. _\:Validate_python:

Regardless of whether you have validation enabled upon saving or not, the
command **:Validate** is available to manual validate the file.

.. _\:PyLint:

**:PyLint** -
Runs the pylint_ tool on the current file, populates the quickfix list with the
results (:h quickfix), and marks all the affected lines using vim's sign
support.

.. note::

  When running **:PyLint**, determining additional directories to be include on
  the path for pylint_ is provided via eclim's integration with
  :ref:`rope <vim/python/rope>`.

  Please see the :ref:`rope <vim/python/rope>` docs for more information.
