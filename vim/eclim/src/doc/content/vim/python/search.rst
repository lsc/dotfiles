Python Search
=============

.. _\:PythonFindDefinition:

Element Search
--------------

Element searching allows you to place the cursor over just about any element in
a source file (method call, class name, constant) and perform a search for that
element by issuing the command **:PhpFindDefinition**.

If only one result is found and that result is in the current source file, the
cursor will be moved to the element found.  Otherwise, on single result
matches, the value of :ref:`g:EclimPythonSearchSingleResult` will be consulted
for the action to take.  If there are multiple results, the location list will
be opened with the list of results.

.. note::

  Searching support is provided via eclim's integration with
  :ref:`rope <vim/python/rope>`.

  Please see the :ref:`rope <vim/python/rope>` docs for more information.

.. _\:PythonSearchContext:

As a convenience eclim also provides the command **:PythonSearchContext**.
This command accepts no arguments and will perform the appropriate search
depending on the context of the element.

- If the cursor is on the declaration of a class, function, or method then it
  will search for all occurrences.
- Otherwise, it will search for the declaration of the element.
