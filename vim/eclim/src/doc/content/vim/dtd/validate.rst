Dtd File Validation
===================

When editing a dtd file eclim will default to validating the file when it is
written. Any errors will be added to the current window's location list (:help
location-list) and their corresponding line number noted via Vim's sign
functionality.

If you do not want your dtd files validated automatically when saved, you can
set the :ref:`g:EclimDtdValidate` variable described in the configuration
section below.

.. _\:Validate_dtd:

Whether or not auto validation has been enabled, eclim also exposes
the command **:Validate** to manually execute the validation of the
file.

Configuration

Vim Variables

.. _g\:EclimDtdValidate:

- **g:EclimDtdValidate** (Default: 1) -
  If set to 0, disables validation when saving the file.
