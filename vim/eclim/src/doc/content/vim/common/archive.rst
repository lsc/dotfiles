Archive Viewer
==============

Eclim includes a plugin which allows you to view the contents of archive files
(jar, tar, tbz2, tgz, zip, and more).

.. code-block:: sh

  $ vim myarchive.tar.gz

Unlike the tar and zip plugins that ship with vim, the eclim version gives you
the option to view and navigate the archive in a tree or list interface, and
supports nested archives.

When viewing the archive you can switch layouts by using **:AsList** to switch
from the tree layout to the list, and **:AsTree** to switch back.

There are also various mappings depending on the view\:

- **Tree**

  - **<enter>** - View the file under the cursor in a new split window, or
    in the case of a directory, expand / collapse it.
  - **o** - For files, this has the same behavior as **<enter>**. For
    directories, it will fold / unfold open directories preserving the state of
    all the sub directories.
  - **p** - Jumps to the nearest parent directory.
  - **P** - Jumps to the furthest child in the currect branch of directories.
  - **i** - Prints the size and date for the file under the cursor.

- **List**

  - **<enter>** - View the file under the cursor in a new split window.
