Local History
=============

When editing files, vim provides great undo support.  However, the undo
information is lost when you close a file or utilize one of the few eclim
features that require a reload of the current file.

Eclipse provides a nice feature which can help combat both of these
deficiencies.  It includes support for a local history, which is basically a
simplistic version control system that is updated every time you save a file.
Using this local history, you can view diffs against previously saved versions
of your file or revert to one of those revisions.

By default, as long as eclimd is running, any writes you make to a file inside
of a project will automatically be saved as a local history revision.

.. _\:History:

**:History** - Opens a temporary buffer showing the local history for the
current file.  In this buffer you can perform the following actions using the
specified key bindings:

- v - view the contents of the revision under the cursor.
- d - diff the revision under the cursor against the current contents.
- r - revert the current file to the revision under the cursor.
- c - clear the local history for the file.


Configuration
--------------

Eclipse Settings

- When writing to the local history, eclim simply proxies the request to
  eclipse, so all eclipse settings are honored.  To modify these settings you
  currently have to do so inside of the eclipse gui.  First shut down eclimd if
  you are running a headless version, then open the eclipse gui and navigate
  to:

  ::

    Window > Preferences > General > Workspace > Local History

  And there you can edit your settings as necessary.

Vim Settings

.. _g\:EclimHistoryDiffOrientation:

- **g:EclimHistoryDiffOrientation (Default: 'vertical')** -
  When initiating diffs, this setting controls whether the diff window is
  opened as a horizontal split or vertical.  Supported values include
  'horizontal' and 'vertical'.
