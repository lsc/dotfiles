Xsd Validation
==============

When editing a xsd file eclim will default to validating the file when it is
written.  Any errors will be added to the current window's location list (:help
location-list) and their corresponding line number noted via Vim's sign
functionality.

If you do not want your xsd files validated automatically when saved, you can
set the :ref:`g:EclimXsdValidate` variable described in the configuration
section below.

.. _\:Validate_xsd:

Whether or not auto validation has been enabled, eclim also exposes
the command **:Validate** to manually execute the validation of the
file.

.. _g\:EclimXsdValidate:

- **g:EclimXsdValidate** (Default: 1) -
  If set to 0, disables validation when saving the file.
