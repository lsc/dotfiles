Vim Doc
=======

.. _\:VimDoc:

To facilitate quick access of Vim help for elements of a Vim script, eclim
provides the command **:VimDoc**.  When executed it will open the help docs for
the supplied argument or for the element under the cursor.  When mapped to a key
binding of your choosing, this command can save you some repetitive typing and
provides an internal map of some keywords to their help topic, which are not
always as straight forward as :help word.

.. note::

  If you come across any instances where this command does not find the
  expected Vim help topic, please report it so that it may be accounted for
  in future revisions.
