Installing / Upgrading
======================

Requirements
------------

Before beginning the installation, first confirm that you have met the
following requirements.

- `Java Development Kit`_ 1.5 or greater
- `Eclipse 3.5.x (Galileo)`_
- `Vim 7.1.x`_

  **Minimum Vim Settings**: In order for eclim to function properly, there is a
  minimum set of vim options that must be enabled in your vimrc file (:h vimrc).

  - **set nocompatible**

    Execute :h 'compatible' for more info.  You can confirm that
    compatibliity is turned off by executing the following:

    .. code-block:: vim

      :echo &compatible

    Which should output '0'.
  - **filetype plugin on**

    Execute :h filetype-plugin-on for more info.  You can confirm
    that file type plugins are enabled by executing the following:

    .. code-block:: vim

      :filetype

    Which should output 'filetype detection:ON  plugin:ON indent:ON', showing
    at least 'ON' for 'detection' and 'plugin'.

.. _installer:

Eclim Graphical Installer
-------------------------

Step 1: Download the eclim installer for your platform.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Linux / Mac / BSD (and other unix based systems)**:
  `eclim_version.sh`_
- **Windows:**
  `eclim_version.exe`_


Step 2: Run the installer.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

  If you have eclipse running, please close it prior to starting the
  installation procedure.

- **Linux / Mac / BSD (and other unix based systems)**:
  You can start the installer by running the script you downloaded
  (note: you may have to make it executable first).

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ chmod 755 eclim_version.sh
    $ ./eclim_version.sh

- **Windows:**
  On Windows systems, simply double click the eclim_version.exe file you
  downloaded.

After the installer starts up, simply follow the steps in the wizard
to install the application.

.. note::

  In some rare cases you might encounter one of the following errors\:

  1. Any exception which denotes usage of gcj.
     ::

       java.lang.NullPointerException
         at org.pietschy.wizard.HTMLPane.updateEditorColor(Unknown Source)
         at org.pietschy.wizard.HTMLPane.setEditorKit(Unknown Source)
         at javax.swing.JEditorPane.getEditorKit(libgcj.so.90)
         ...

     Gcj (GNU Compile for Java), is not currently supported.  If you receive any
     error which references libgcj, then gcj is your current default jvm. So,
     you'll need to install a sun jvm to resolve the installation error.

  2.
    ::

      java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError
        at org.formic.ant.logger.Log4jLogger.printMessage(Log4jLogger.java:51)
        ...

    This is most likely caused by an incompatible version of log4j installed in
    your jave ext.dirs.  To combat this you can run the installer like so\:

    ::

      $ FORMIC_OPTS="-Djava.ext.dirs" ./eclim_1.4.0.sh


Step 3: Testing the installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To test eclim you first need to start the eclim daemon.  How you start the
daemon will depend on how you intend to use eclim.

If you plan on using eclim along with the eclipse gui, then:

- start eclipse with the -clean option

  ::

    $ eclipse -clean

  .. note::

    You should only need to start eclipse with the -clean option the first time
    after installing or upgrading eclim.

- open the eclimd view

  Window -> Show View -> Other -> Eclim -> eclimd

If you plan on using eclim without the eclipse gui, then:

- start the eclimd server.

  - **Linux / Mac / BSD (and other unix based systems)**:
    To start eclimd from linux, simply execute the eclimd script found in your
    eclipse root directory:

    ::

      $ $ECLIPSE_HOME/eclimd

  - **Windows**: The easiest way to start eclimd in windows is to double
    click on the eclimd.bat file found in your eclipse root directory:
    %ECLIPSE_HOME%/eclimd.bat

Once you have the eclim daemon (headed or headless) running, you can then test
eclim:

- open a vim window and issue the command, :ref:`:PingEclim`.  The result of
  executing this command should be the eclim and eclipse version echoed to the
  bottom of your Vim window.  If however, you receive ``unable to connect to
  eclimd - connect: Connection refused``, or something similar, then your
  eclimd server is not running or something is preventing eclim from connecting
  to it.  If you receive this or any other errors you can start by first
  examining the eclimd output to see if it gives any info as to what went
  wrong.  If at this point you are unsure how to proceed you can view the
  :ref:`troubleshooting guide <guides/troubleshoot>` or feel free to post your
  issue on the `eclim user`_ mailing list.

    Example of successful ping:

    .. image:: ../images/screenshots/ping_success.png

    Example of failed ping:

    .. image:: ../images/screenshots/ping_failed.png

- Regardless of the ping result, you can also verify your vim settings
  using the command **:EclimValidate**.  This will check
  various settings and options and report any problems. If all is ok
  you will receive the following message\:

  ::

    Result: OK, required settings are valid.


What's Next
-----------

Now that you have eclim installed, the next step is to familiarize yourself
with at least the core set of commands that eclim provides, all of which are
found at the index of the eclim :ref:`documentation <vim/index>`.

After doing that you can then proceed to create your first project\:

- :ref:`Java Project Guide <guides/java/project>`
- :ref:`Python Project Guide <guides/python/project>`
- :ref:`Php Project Guide <guides/php/project>`


Upgrading
---------

The upgrading procedure is the same as the installation procedure but please be
aware that the installer will remove the previous version of eclim prior to
installing the new one.  The installer will delete all the files in the eclim
eclipse plugins and the files eclim adds to your .vim or vimfiles directory.
So if you made any alterations to any of these files, be sure to back them up
prior to upgrading.


Building from source
--------------------

If you would like to use the bleeding edge development version of eclim or you
would like to contribute code, then you can checkout and build eclim from
source.  Instructions on doing so can be found in the
:ref:`developers guide <development-build>`.
