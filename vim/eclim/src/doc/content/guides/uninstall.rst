Uninstalling
============

Uninstalling eclim consists of simply removing the eclipse and vim plugins installed\:

- <eclipse_home>/plugins/org.eclim*

  Remove all directories under plugins that start with ``org.eclim``.

  - if you are using a package manager installed version of eclipse, then the
    plugins directory where eclim is installed may be under
    ``~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_<version>/configuration/eclipse/plugins``

- <vimfiles>/eclim

  Remove the eclim directory under your vimfiles dir.

  - on unix based systems, this should be ``~/.vim/eclim``
  - on Windows systems, this should be ``%HOME%/vimfiles``

- <vimfiles>/plugin/eclim.vim

  Lastly remove eclim.vim from your vim plugin directory.
