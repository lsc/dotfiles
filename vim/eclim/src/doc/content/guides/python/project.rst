Creating A Python Project
=========================

The goal of this guide is to walk you through creating your first python project
via eclim.


Creating a project
------------------

The first step is to open a Vim window and create the project by executing\:

.. code-block:: vim

  :ProjectCreate /path/to/my_project -n none

The path supplied will be the path to the root of your project.  This path may
or may not exist.  If it does not exist it will be created for you.

Once you've created your project you can use the
**:ProjectList** command to list the available projects and
you should see your newly created one in the list.

::

  my_project - open   - /path/to/my_project

The **:ProjectList** result is in the form of
``projectName - (open|closed) - /project/root/path``.  When you create projects,
the last path element will be used for the project name.  If that element
contains any spaces, these will be converted to underscores.


Editing project settings
------------------------

After creating a project, the next thing you'll probably want to do is edit
your project's settings.  To do this you can use the :ref:`:ProjectSettings`
command.  If your current Vim window's working directory is at or under the
project's root directory then you can execute the **:ProjectSettings** with no
arguments, otherwise you will need to supply the project name.

.. code-block:: vim

  :ProjectSettings projectName

After your first time editing your project's settings, a .settings directory
will be created in the project's root directory.  In there are the project's
preferences files.  You should avoid editing these files directly and stick to
using **:ProjectSettings** to update them.

.. note::

  If you have only one project or many projects that share the same settings
  you can use the :ref:`:EclimSettings` command instead to edit the global
  settings.  These global settings will apply to any project that has not
  overridden them with values via **:ProjectSettings**.

Now that you have a project created, you can now leverage the various
:ref:`python features <vim/python/index>` that eclim provides.
