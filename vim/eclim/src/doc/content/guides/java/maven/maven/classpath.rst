Maven: Maintain Classpath
=========================

Maven_ 1.x comes bundled with an Eclipse plugin that allows you to easily
maintain your .classpath file based on your project.xml.  This guide will walk
you through the steps of setting this up for the first time and continual usage
there after.

.. note::

  For additional information on the Eclipse plugin from maven, you may visit
  their `online documentation`_.

Initial Setup
-------------

To initialize maven's support for updating the eclipse classpath you first need
to set the ``MAVEN_REPO`` variable in the Eclipse workspace by
executing the following command which is made available when editing the
project.xml file in vim:

.. code-block:: vim

  :MavenRepo


Updating .classpath
-------------------

Once you have performed the :ref:`initial setup <:MavenRepo>`, updating the
Eclipse ``.classpath`` file is as easy as executing the following at a command
line\:

::

  maven eclipse

or in Vim\:

.. code-block:: vim

  :Maven eclipse
