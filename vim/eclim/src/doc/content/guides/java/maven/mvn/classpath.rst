Mvn: Maintain Classpath
=======================

Maven_ 2.x comes bundled with an Eclipse plugin that allows you to easily
maintain your .classpath file based on your pom.xml.  This guide will walk you
through the steps of setting this up for the first time and continual usage
there after.

.. note::

  For additional information on the Eclipse plugin from maven, you may visit
  their `online documentation`_.

Initial Setup
-------------

To initialize maven's support for updating the eclipse classpath you first need
to set the ``M2_REPO`` variable in the Eclipse workspace by executing the
following command which is made available when editing the pom.xml file in vim:

.. code-block:: vim

  :MvnRepo


Updating .classpath
-------------------

Once you have performed the :ref:`initial setup <:MvnRepo>`, updating the
Eclipse ``.classpath`` file is as easy as executing the following at a command
line\:

::

  mvn eclipse:eclipse

or in Vim\:

.. code-block:: vim

  :Mvn eclipse:eclipse
