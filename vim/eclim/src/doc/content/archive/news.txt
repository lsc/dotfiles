Several new additions over the past couple weeks:

* Java code completion: Integrated into Vim via Vim 7's new "User Defined
  Completion".

* Added eclim command line support for creating and updating projects,
  including Vim support for editing Eclipse .classpath files and updating
  Eclipse upon writing of those files.

* Integrated nailgun_ to greatly improve the command line client performance.

* Started documenting eclim and its features.

With the addition of these features I'm going to stop adding new
functionality for the time being and focus on testing and ensuring that
everything works as expected on Windows.

Code navigation / searching is done!  Most of the Vim integration for
searching is done as well.  The only thing missing is viewing code for
results that are found in a jar file that have no corresponding source
attachment.  I may end up doing what Eclipse appears to do, which is
to use javap to display the class and method signatures.  That or I'll
use jad to decompile the whole source.  My only issue with jad, is
that it is not up to date with the 1.5 byte code.

I also have automated importing done as well.  The eclim server
request just returns a list of possible results to import for a given
request and the editor (Vim in this case) handles prompting the user
and updating the code.

.. note::
  The Vim integration now requires Vim 7.  Even though Vim 7 is still
  alpha, I haven't had any major issues with it and the new additions to
  the Vim scripting language are just too good to pass up.

My next step is to start documenting everything and testing on a
Windows environment to ensure there aren't any compatibility issues.

After that I should be ready to put out a preliminary release.
I'm trying to be very careful about releasing anything too soon.  The
last thing I want it to scare anyone off with a broken project that
doesn't seem to work properly.

Sourceforge site is up!  Now it's just a matter of getting the ball rolling
again.

I'm hoping to have source code navigation working by the end of next week.
This includes the ability to simply hit <enter> on a class name, method
name, method call, etc. to jump to its declaration.  Basically I want to
replace my previous
`Vim plug-in <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1106>`_ with the
new Eclipse one.

Before I put out any releases though, I want to have a comprehensive
set of documentation.  For the first few releases, setup will probably
be pretty manual, with most of it occurring through the Eclipse
interface.  Going forward, I want to move more of that functionality
into Vim.
