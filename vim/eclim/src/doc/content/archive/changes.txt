  - <anchor id="upgrade_1.2.0"/>
    Re-organized eclim files within the vim runtime path.
    Based on suggestion by Marc Weber.

    .. warning::
      This change will require you to remove all the old eclim vim plugins
      prior to installing the new set.  A comprehensive list of plugins to
      be deleted is provided
      <a href="upgrade/resources/1.2.0/vim_plugin_list.txt">here</a>.

      You may also use one of the following scripts to help automate the
      process.  Just download the appropriate file to the directory where
      you extracted the eclim vim plugins and execute it.  Please review the
      script before executing it so that you are aware of what it does.
      Please report any issues as well.

      **\*nix users**:
        | <a href="upgrade/resources/1.2.0/upgrade.sh">upgrade.sh</a>
        | Be sure to either make the file executable
        | $ chmod 755 upgrade.sh
        | or run via sh
        | $ sh upgrade.sh

      **Windows users**:
        | <a href="upgrade/resources/1.2.0/upgrade.bat">upgrade.bat</a>
        | Run via a command prompt so that you can monitor the output.

      After executing either of these scripts you may be left with one or
      more empty directories which are then safe to delete.

      I appologize for this inconvience, and hopefully this change will
      help ease future upgrades.

Vim:
  - Added <a href="vim/vim/find.html#FindFunctionVariableContext">
    **:FindFunctionVariableContext** </a>
    to perform context sensitive searching for vim functions or global
    variables.
  - Added
    **<a href="vim/common/util.html#Split::Split</a>**,
    **<a href="vim/common/util.html#SplitRelative::SplitRelative</a>**,
    **<a href="vim/common/util.html#EditRelative::EditRelative</a>**,
    **<a href="vim/common/util.html#LocateFileEdit::LocateFileEdit</a>**,
    **<a href="vim/common/util.html#LocateFileSplit::LocateFileSplit</a>**,
    and
    **<a href="vim/common/util.html#LocateFileTab::LocateFileTab</a>**,

.. _1.1.2:

1.1.2 (May 07, 2006)
---------------------

Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed eclipse .classpath commands.
  - Fixed java project update commands to refresh the project resources so
    that new jars are recognized when added to the .classpath file.
  - `Bug 1437025 <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1437025&group_id=145869&atid=763323>`_
  - `Bug 1437005 <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1437005&group_id=145869&atid=763323>`_

    the completion.
  - `Bug 1440606 <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1440606&group_id=145869&atid=763323>`_

    .. note::

      The original implementation of
      <a href="vim/java/import.html#JavaImportClean">**:JavaImportClean**</a>
      was written entirely in vim (didn't require eclim server).  To
      properly handle ignoring comments when determining what imports are
      unused, this functionality had to be reimplemented with server side
      help.  However, the vim only version is preserved and will be invoked
      if the current file is not in an eclipse project.

  - Other various bug fixes.

Ant:
  - Added <a href="vim/java/ant/run.html">**:Ant**</a> command
    to allow execution of ant from any file.

    <a href="vim/java/constructor.html">**:JavaConstructor**</a>.

  - Added <a href="vim/java/doc.html">**:JavaDocComment**</a>
    command to add or update javadocs comment for the element under the
    cursor.
  - Added <a href="vim/java/regex.html">**:JavaRegex**</a>
    for testing java regular expressions.
  - JDT classpath_variables.properties no longer requires system property
    placeholder to use '_' instead of '.'.
  - Velocity templates broken up into more logical templates to ease
    customization.
  - <a href="vim/java/bean.html">**:JavaGetSet**</a>
    now has variable to determine whether or not to add indexed getters and
    setters.
  - Removed preference org.eclim.java.validation.ignore.warnings in favor of
    new <a href="vim/index.html#EclimSignLevel:g:EclimSignLevel</a>.

Vim:
  - Added couple miscellaneous
    <a href="vim/common/util.html">vim commands</a> for use in or outside of
    eclim context.
  - Added
    <a href="vim/common/taglist.html">
    groovy script based ctags implementation
    </a>
    for use with the vim taglist plugin.

    the quickfix window, now utilizes vim's new location list functionality.

    etc.

.. _1.1.1:

1.1.1 (Feb. 19, 2006)
---------------------

Bug Fixes:
  - Code completion results now sorted by type and then alphabetically.
  - Code corrections that cannot be applied in the standard way (those
    with no previews) are excluded.
  - Simple searching from spring / hiberate / web.xml files is fixed.
  - Java import command is now restricted to the current project.
  - Java src file location (for almost all java commands) now uses the full
    path to find the file in eclipse rather than build the path from the
    file's package declaration and class name.  Fixes cases where the
    package name doesn't match up with the folder structure.
  - Xml validation errors that occur when no dtd is defined are filtered
    out (limitation of using xerces to support jdk 1.4).
  - Relative xml entities are now resolved when validating an xml file.

  - Fixed possible error when removing signs for marking errors / warnings

    <a href="vim/java/impl.html#JavaImpl">**:JavaImpl**</a>
    or
    <a href="vim/java/junit.html#JUnitImpl">**:JUnitImpl**</a>,
    if the target
    class was an inner class of the src file, then the methods were being
    added to the outer class instead of the inner class.
  - Fixed javadoc search results to restore <enter> as mapping to open
    result in a browser after the quickfix window is closed and then opened
    again.
  - Other various bug fixes.

Eclipse:
  - Eclim now depends on eclispe version 3.1.2.  The Eclipse team made some
    improvements to how inner classes are handled that eclim now depends on.

Eclim:
  - Added support for global settings/preferences via new
    <a href="vim/index.html#EclimSettings">**:EclimSettings**</a>
    command.

    <a href="vim/mappings.html">suggested set of mappings</a>.
  - Now utilizing vim's autoload functionality to load functions on demand.

    One vim file was moved as a result, so you should delete the old file
    when upgrading.
