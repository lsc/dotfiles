Eclim Architecture
==================

The eclim architecture is pretty straight forward.  Commands issued by a user
in vim are relayed via nailgun_ to the running eclim daemon and the proper
command implementation is then located and executed.

Here is a diagram showing the sequence in a bit more detail:

The commands which are executed on the eclimd side are also fairly simply.
They accept an object containing the command line parameters passed into the
eclimd invocation and then return a string representing the output.  Below is a
simple class diagram showing the hierarchy of a couple typical commands.

Another important aspect of eclim's architecture is support for plugins.
Plugins for eclim are bundled as eclipse plugins with their auto start
attribute set to false.  When the eclim daemon starts it will locate and load
any eclipse plugin with an 'org.eclim.' prefix.

When a plugin is loaded, eclim will locate the plugin's required resources
provider and invoke its initialize method which will then inject its resources
(messages, command options, etc) into eclim and register any new commands.

Here is graphical representation of this process:
