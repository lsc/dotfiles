Author: Matt Cauthorn, for f5 Networks.

===========================NOTES ==========================================

Note: This pulls together/modifies several plugins and a .vimrc
from the web and glues them together with iControl, python, 
a syntax file, and a completion dictionary. Credits are given to
the original authors where appropriate.

Note: Once again, thanks to Jason Rahm, ever the early-adopter for
projects. A Jason helped me find an early issue that really made this
better. Also, thanks to the and the DevCentral team.

Note: For auto-complete of brackets and such, either install delimitMate
or uncomment the auto-bracket section below.

Note: I've not included colorschemes, so be sure and install them if you
want them.
